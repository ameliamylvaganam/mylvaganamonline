        She steps into the car, ducking her head down as she slides inside. The
        crosswalk light changes and Liz and I take its cue. We look back to see
        the car turning, Sam waving through the window as
        <a href="#link2">she's carried away</a>.

          She came and went, and in her leaving I didn't expect to try my
          hardest to <a href="#link3">hold on to her</a> in the way that I have.

          Today I'm thinking of buying a perfume for myself even though I never
          wear scent, because she likes to wear scent, and maybe I'll start.<br />

          "Why are you finite?" she asked me when I said that sometimes it feels
          like the more of yourself that you share with the world, the less you
          have left. But she was right- <a href="#link6">I'm not finite</a>.

          I could give everything to her and still have myself left. Then there
          would be two me's, one tucked into the breast pocket of her button
          down and the other sitting during her workday, writing in her little
          red notebook, something a cross between the truth and her feelings.<br /><a
